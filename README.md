Problem Statement
Managing hotel room reservations manually is time-consuming and prone to human errors. Customers often face issues such as lack of real-time room availability information, booking conflicts, and delays in confirming reservations. Similarly, hotel staff struggle to keep accurate records of bookings, cancellations, and customer details when using traditional methods like paper logs or spreadsheets.
To solve these challenges, there is a need for an automated Hotel Reservation System that allows customers to book rooms, check availability, and cancel reservations easily. The system should also help hotel staff manage room inventory, customer details, and reservations efficiently

Project Description:
The Hotel Reservation System is a Java application that enables users to view available rooms, make bookings, and cancel reservations. It follows Object-Oriented Programming principles such as Encapsulation and Abstraction to ensure a modular and organized design. The system provides an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing hotel room reservations, improving overall booking and management processes.

Target Users:
The target users of the Hotel Reservation System include hotel guests, who want a simple and convenient way to book or cancel rooms; hotel staff, who manage room availability and customer reservations; and travel agents, who handle bookings on behalf of customers. This system is designed to make the reservation process efficient and user-friendly for all these groups.
